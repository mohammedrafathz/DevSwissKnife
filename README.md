# DevSwissKnife
Dev Swiss Knife is a web app with essential development tools that boost developer productivity and ease many daily tasks. We’re trying to bring different features like image compressing, HTML, CSS &amp; JS minification, beatification, XML and JSÍON formatting, PDF manipulation, colour selection, text recognition, manipulation tools and  a few other unified features into one web app. Developers can scroll through or search tools and use any  device according to their needs in one place instead of jumping across multiple tools or platforms to do simple  or specific tasks.
